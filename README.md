# Productivity App

## Overview

Welcome to the Productivity App project! This application is designed to enhance your productivity by offering a suite of tools to manage your tasks, notes, reminders, and more. As a starting point, we are developing a Todo application, and the architecture is built to be scalable for easy integration of additional features.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly designing responsive and aesthetic interfaces.
- **Redux:** A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, facilitating efficient state management.

## Features

### Todo Application

The current focus of the project is on the Todo application. Users can:

- **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Remove Tasks:** Delete tasks that are no longer relevant.
- **Update Tasks:** Modify task details to stay organized.
- **Toggle as Complete:** Mark tasks as complete for better tracking.

## Getting Started

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Productivity-App.git


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
